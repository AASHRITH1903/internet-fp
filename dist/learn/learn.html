                <h3>Unlike a car that emits fuel through its exhaust pipe, Pollution caused 
                    by internet is not direct.
                </h3>
                <p>Internet carbon footprint is mainly a result of the power required to keep 
                    its infrastructure running. Mobile phone antennas, the devices we use to 
                    access the internet, and data centres all require enormous amounts of 
                    electricity. This electricity can come from renewable sources, but it often does not.
                </p>

                <p>Data centres are the second most power-hungry elements of the internet, 
                    after devices. To get an idea of the energy needs of data centres, Facebook 
                    is building one in Prineville, Oregon that will consume around 78 megawatts 
                    of electricity, equal to around 64,000 homes.
                </p>
                <p>The report “How Clean is Your Cloud?” found that 55.1% of the electricity used 
                    by Apple servers is generated by coal plants, as is 49.7% of the energy used 
                    by IBM servers, and 39.4% in the case of Facebook servers.  These considerable 
                    figures entail thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere 
                    and the dirty air that goes with it.

                <p>The carbon footprint of our gadgets, the internet and the systems 
                    supporting them account for about 3.7% of global greenhouse emissions, 
                    according to some estimates. It is similar to the amount produced by the 
                    airline industry globally, explains Mike Hazas, a researcher at Lancaster 
                    University. And these emissions are predicted to double by 2025.
                </p>
                <p>One study estimated that 10 years ago, the average Australian internet user 
                    was responsible for the equivalent of 81kg (179lbs) of carbon dioxide (CO2e) 
                    being emitted into the atmosphere.
                </p>
                <p>In the US, data centres are responsible for 2% of the country’s electricity use, 
                    while globally they account for just under 200 terawatt Hours (TWh).

                    tonnes of carbon a year – the equivalent to taking 3,334 diesel cars 
                    off the road, according to energy company, OVO.

                <p>Regardless of the search engine you choose, using the web to find 
                    information is more sustainable than browsing in books. In fact, 
                    a paperback’s carbon footprint is around 1kg (2.2lbs) CO2e, while 
                    a weekend newspaper accounts for between 0.3kg (10oz) and 4.1kg 
                    (9lbs) CO2e making reading the news online more environmentally friendly 
                    than poring over a paper.But you could read a lifetime of paperbacks – 
                    2,300 to be precise – for the same carbon footprint as a flight from London to 
                    Hong Kong, so don’t feel too guilty for reading the next best seller.

                         In March 2013, Apple announced that all of its server centres now work with renewable 
                         energy, even though this announcement is a bit misleading as part of this target is being 
                         achieved through the purchase of carbon credits to offset the nuclear and coal-fuelled 
                         electricity used by some of its centres. The company has also built two solar energy plants 
                         in Maiden (North Carolina) to meet the needs of its server plants in the area. In addition, 
                         it is building a data centre in Prineville, Oregon, that will run on a mix of solar, 
                         hydroelectric, wind and geothermic energy.
                        <br />
                        Meanwhile, Facebook, is building a data centre in Iowa that will run entirely on wind power, 
                        which is expected to open in 2015. The company has set itself the target of powering its data 
                        centres on 25% renewable energy by 2015. In 2011, Facebook launched the Open Compute Project, 
                        an initiative through which to share its data centre management information and know-how in 
                        order to encourage industry best practices and help others to maximise their efficiency.

                        and data centres with more efficient and sustainable methods of storing and processing 
                        information. Carbon Offset is also a best method  to reduce
                        Carbon footprint if implemented effectively.
